Open-Source-Sensor-Fusion
=========================

The memsindustrygroup/Open-Source-Sensor-Fusion GitHub site is a subset of the Accelerated Innovation Cooperative effort, sponsored by MEMS Industry Group (MIG).   AIC champions community development of an open source repository of algorithms and datasets for sensor fusion and analytics.  The formal announcement of this effort occured at the Nov 2014 MEMS Executive Congress.   Included, you can see:
* C source library for 3, 6 and 9-axis sensor fusion
* Sensor fusion datasheet which provides an overview of the sensor fusion library capabilities, including electrical and computation metrics
* Sensor fusion user guide
* Basic tutorial information relating to sensor fusion

There is extensive documentation in the associated wiki, which you can access via the toolboar to the right.
